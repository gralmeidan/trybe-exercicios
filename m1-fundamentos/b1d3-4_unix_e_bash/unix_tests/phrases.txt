Do you think God lives in heaven because he, too, fears what he has created?
-Dr. Romero, Spy Kids 2

Nobody likes to change. There will always be resistance to change. And the quicker you get to that, the easier it is. It's not such a difficult thing. If you entrench yourself and go, 'by God, I will not change. I will not have this.’ Then, you’re a dead man. We're great at adaptability. It's our strongest suit.
-Nick Nolte, Collider Interview

You’ve got to make a statement. You’ve got to look inside yourself and say: 'what am I willing to put up with today?’
-Arin Hanson, Game Grumps (Sonic 06 Part 20)

Whenever you look at another creator or an artist that you respect, you're only seeing what took them a long time of work and doubt to push through. You never see the struggle behind it. So you think you’re the only one struggling, when in fact, everyone goes through it.
-Danny Sexbang/Avidan, Game Grumps

Too many people have opinions on things they know nothing about. And the more ignorant they are, the more opinions they have.

What is better- To be born good, or to overcome your evil nature through great effort?
-Paarthurnax, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim

Pick a god and pray.

Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something.

There’s no point in being grown up if you can’t act childish at times.

Men are props on the stage of life, and no matter how tender, how exquisite... A lie will remain a lie.
-Aldia, Dark Souls 2

Then become the dirt I walk on.
-pukicho, Tumblr

To feel sorrow is to deserve peace.
-Anon, 1d4Chan

Can you feel your heart burning? Can you feel the struggle within? The fear within me is beyond anything your soul can make. You cannot kill me in a way that matters.
-Mushroom, personsonable’s Tumblr post
 
You are alone, child. There is only darkness for you, and only death for your people. These ancients are just the beginning. I will command a great and terrible army... and we will sail to a billion worlds. We will sail until every light has been extinguished. You are strong, child. But I am beyond strength.
-Lich, Adventure Time (Escape From The Citadel)
He has already begun painting the picture, now we must decide to finish it.

When someone leaves your life those exits… are… not made equal. Some are beautiful, and poetic, and satisfying. Others are abrupt and unfair, but most are just unremarkable, unintentional, clumsy.

You could sooner divert a river from its course than deny my nature.

Sometimes life puts you in difficult circumstances you didn't choose, but being happy or unhappy is a choice you make, and I've chosen to make the best of things that I can.
-Shahvee, The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim

You don't have to be alive to make yourself relevant, And you don't have to be a good person to be a hero. You just have to know who you are, and stay true to that. So I'm going to keep fighting for people the only way I ever knew how, By being me.

Always remember that the crowd that applauds your coronation is the same crowd that will applaud your beheading. People like a show.
-Terry Pratchet, Discworld (Going Postal)

See, Sarah Lynn? We're not doomed. In the great, grand scheme of things, we're just tiny specks that will one day be forgotten. So it doesn't matter what we did in the past, or how we'll be remembered. The only thing that matters is right now, this moment, this one spectacular moment we are sharing together. Right, Sarah Lynn?
-Bojack Horseman, Bojack Horseman (That’s Too Much, Man)

You know, it's funny... when you look at someone through rose-colored glasses, all the red flags just look like flags.
-Wanda, Bojack Horseman (Yes And…)

Sometimes, Life’s a Bitch and then you keep living.
-Diane Nyugen, Bojack Horseman (Nice While It Lasted)

You do everything you can to make up for it, knowing that you’ll never succeed in getting rid of the guilt. You devote yourself to spending every second trying to do better despite the fact that it will never be enough. And you pray with every single good act you do that somehow, when your life is over, that you came close to making up for the wrong you committed.
-Watcher, Fallout: Equestria: Project Horizons

I will seize destiny by the throat and force it into the shape of my choosing.
-mollyjames, Tumblr

The sins of the ancient burn the souls of the ancestors.
-sanctumofwaluigi, Tumblr

What brings me joy is… life. I think you can find joy anywhere, in life. I think it’s a conscious choice. I think you- you choose joy, in life. And no matter how bad things are, no matter how crummy, no matter how dark. You find joy. I find joy in whatever I do. I don’t always do things right, and I don’t always do things smart. But whatever I do, I find joy in it.

I can’t go to Hell. I’m all out of vacation days.
-Burgerpants, Undertale

You understand reality while everyone else is running around confused and angry and upset because they think reality is something happening to them rather than something they are making every moment with every thought.

You are braver than you believe, stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.
-Christopher Robin, Winnie The Pooh

Authority should derive from the consent of the governed, not from the threat of force.
-Barbie, Toy Story 3

Love is not a decision, it is a feeling. It would be much easier if we could choose whom we loved, but much less magical.
-Mr. Twig, South Park

We do have a lot in common. The same Earth, the same air, the same sky. Maybe if we started looking at what's the same instead of what's different... well who knows?

-bbsailorbitch, Twitter

I came out here, to this point, to this place, hoping against all hope and despite signs and portends suggesting otherwise that I might, somehow, find myself having a pleasant experience, and yet here I stand, alone against the world, feeling bombarded and assaulted on all fronts, knowing not my enemy's name, nor his face, nor whether our battle is done.
-Fencer-X, Tumblr

The penance you pay for the way you behave is written as plain as the name on this grave.
-Death, Epic Rap Battles Of History (Ebenezer Scrooge vs. Donald Trump)

Some humans- just as some [us]- are capable of unspeakable acts. But despite all the violence in your history, you have endured, built civilizations, constructed great wonders of technology to broaden your horizons and forge friendships across all manner of divides. I strongly believe that this is not some grand miracle... but merely your own deepest nature, struggling to express itself through the distrust and fear that thousands of years spent living on a harsh, unforgiving world have bred into you.
-Princess Luna, Written in Dust

We both stared into the abyss, but when it looked back... you blinked.
-Owlman, Doomsday Clock

I’m just a program designed to make ha-ha. A file named Laugh Man.
-Raph Chestang, Collegehumor (A Computer Co-Wrote This Sketch)

“You ever wonder if this is Heaven now? You ever wonder if we're all just there now and we don't know it?”
“I've thought about that. All of us have. There's a lot less people who go to church than there used to be, because that's what a lot of people think. But I don't think so. But I think about it. And I think, well, I can't be. Because I'm like you, I kinda look at the big long life ahead of me that stretches out forever and disappears. And I get scared. And I think, ‘This can't be Heaven if I'm getting scared, right?’ And then I think, ‘maybe I am in Heaven, and Heaven is scary.’”
“...I know exactly what you mean.”

-Brennan Lee Mulligan, Collegehumor (Tide CEO: Soap Isn’t Medicine)

There can be no bravery, without madness.
-The Ancestor, Darkest Dungeon

Prolong this world's stasis or face the heart of its infection. I'd urge you to take that harder path, but what end may come, the decision rests with you.
-Hornet, Hollow Knight

It's always important to remember that every day can be beautiful if you want it to be. Every day starts in the dark...and ends in the dark...but in the middle, there is light.
-Russel Hobbs, The Gorillaz

Decay exists as an extant form of life.
-personsonable, Tumblr

My point is that, if death is certain anyway, what’s the harm in trying to live a little longer? At the very worst, you’ll still end up dead like you wanted, but at best, you might actually be happy.
-DWK, Totally Legit Recap

If all I care about in life is the imprints I make in this world, then the most I’ll ever leave is a grave.

For strange eons had come to pass, and death itself had indeed finally died, and that which the long dead would have called the real was strange, and the living lived only because of the benevolent grace of an eternal lie.
